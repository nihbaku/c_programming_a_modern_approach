## Notes for C

- C was originally developed in the 1970s. It was a result of the UNIX project and its predececor was B, where it got its name from.

- GCC is a compiler which handles most errors in modern times. For more through third party programms one can use splint (secure programming lint).

- Additionally one can use software for bound checking (array subscript bound errors) and leak finding (memory issues).

- C is a fairly low level language. That also makes it hard to understand sometimes but also very powerful

- C's strenghts are: 
    - that it is efficient (can run on limited amount of memory and fast)
    - it is powerful, one can accomplish a lot in just a few lines of code (seems a little weird in times of python, but with assembly as one measure it is definitely true.
    - it is very portable. (UNIX like systems all run on c)


- C's weaknesses are that can be error-prone, hard to understand and hard to modify.

- Being a good C programmer comes with understanding the strengths and weaknesses of C and optimizing code for it.
