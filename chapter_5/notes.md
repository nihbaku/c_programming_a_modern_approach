# Selection statements

- In C most statements besides return and the expression from chapter 4 only fall into 3 categories:
    - Selection statement like if or switch.
    - Iteration statements like loops.
    - Jump statements like break, continue and the already know return.

- The other statements are the compound which groups other statements together and the null statement.

- In C there is no inherent boolean type. The comparison "i < j" either gives 0 (false) or 1 (true).
